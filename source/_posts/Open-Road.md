'Open Road' is one of my first artistic pieces, as I was learning the wide variety of tools accessible at the (now defunct) makerspace TechShop. It symbolizes a powerful moment of feeling freedom, captured in this moment during a motorcycle road trip through the high desert.

Materials:
- 1.5" x 1.5" pine, laser-etched
- laser-cut acrylic sheets
