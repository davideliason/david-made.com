Lumenary is an interactive art installation that was displayed at Portland's 2019 Winter Light Festival. It was conceived as a modern-day interpretation of Hildegard von Bingen's illuminated manuscript [Humanity and Life.](https://arthistoryproject.com/artists/hildegard-von-bingen/scivias-i.6-humanity-and-life/)
