BSG-Enigma was my first public art installation, displayed at the 2018 SOAK Art & Music fesitval. It used sensors and programmable LEDs to provide an interactive light experience for people who drew close to the piece, and the Raspberry Pi sported an Express server running on Node.js, serving up a website sharing the concept.

The concept was to consider some of the metaphysical dimensions of the series Battlestar Galactica, of which there were plenty! This conversation was aligned with the SOAK festival's artistic theme of "Parallel Universes."


Materials:
- various pieces of salvaged and recycled wood
- programmable LEDs
- ultrasonic sensor
- Raspberry Pi and 8" touchscreen
- a sad GPS module which gave up the ghost
